# sway_config

My cyberpunk styled Sway Window manager config based of https://github.com/Roboron3042/Cyberpunk-Neon

For missing waybar icons: install otf-awesome-fonts and ttf-awesome-fonts, also run the papirus kolorizer install script

Copy files from swaync folder to /etc/xdg/swaync

Wofi theme is based of https://github.com/Paulobergine/arch_dotfiles

Hyprland configs are from https://github.com/taylor85345/hyprland-dotfiles

Swaync config is from https://github.com/lvntcnylmz/dotfiles/

Fish config is from DistroTube https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dotfiles/-/blob/master/.config/fish/config.fish and it's slightly modified.

Spotify waybar script is from https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar/blob/master/resources/custom_modules/mediaplayer.py

Repo also includes sway-interactive-screenshot binary (https://github.com/moverest/sway-interactive-screenshot)
It's found at .config/sway/scripts

There is also pw-volume https://github.com/smasher164/pw-volume , no idea if that works since I have not figured out how to control volume... (this is solved by installing pulseaudio-utils on fedora and debian, arch has pw-volume on the aur)
